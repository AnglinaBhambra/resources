## Introduction

__Supervised Learning__: where we give the algorithm a dataset with the "right answers" included.  
  
__Regression__ problem: predicting a continuous valued output.
- For example, we think of price as a scalar value, as a continuous value number. Although we could also round the price so that it would be a descrete variable.  
  
__Classification__: predicting a discrete value output, zero or one. (You can have more than 2 output values.)
